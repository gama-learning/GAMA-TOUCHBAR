# GAMA-TOUCHBAR
GAMA-TOUCHBAR is a BTT preset for GAMA. This preset helps GAMA users to quickly add GAML templates to their code. The idea is to help beginners with GAML templates and advanced users can modify it themselves or contribute it to this project.

## Quick Walkthrough 



#### Mandatory

Mute and Esc button exist at all levels of the GAMA-TOUCHBAR, this is to help you mute your system volume in an urgent or unexpected situation without having to quit GAMA-TOUCHBAR. 



#### Root

At the top level (root level) you will see the bar as below. The left most blue set is for code navigation. If you want to search for occurences of a variable in a model, you can search in forward (>>) or backward (<<) direction. The magnifying glass is used for looking for a variable in the model outline. **aA** helps you refactor a variable in the entire model and the anchor button looks for the declaration of a variable (object).
